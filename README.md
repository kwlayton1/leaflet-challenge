### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization  - completed (modified to enlarge bubbles and add legend) many thanks to Geronimo Perez for his assistance (during tutoring session). 
####Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Legend created.

##### Part 2: (Optional not done) Gather and Plot More Data
